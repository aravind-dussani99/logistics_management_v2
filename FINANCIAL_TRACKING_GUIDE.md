### Step 1: Set Up Your Accounts (The Foundation)

Before you can track money, you need to tell the system where it can come from and where it can go. This is your **Chart of Accounts**.

1.  **Define Categories:** Go to the **`Categories`** page. This is where you create your high-level financial buckets. Examples:
    *   `Bank Account`
    *   `Capital & Loans` (for hand loans, credit cards, etc.)
    *   `Investment` (for money you put into other ventures)
    *   `Personal Funds` (for your own money used in the business)
    *   `Operational Expense`

2.  **Create Specific Accounts:** Go to the **`Accounts`** page. Here, you create a specific account for *every single financial entity* and assign it a category.
    *   **Bank Accounts:** Create an account for each bank you use (e.g., "INDUSIND Bank", "HDFC Bank").
    *   **Loans:** If you take a hand loan, create an account for it (e.g., "Hand Loan from Thathireddy"). Do the same for credit cards ("ICICI Credit Card").
    *   **Your Money:** Create an account for the money you personally put in (e.g., "My Savings").
    *   **Investments:** If you invest in another business, create an account for it (e.g., "Quarry Investment").

> **Golden Rule:** If money can be sent to it or received from it, it needs to be an Account.

### Step 2: Record Every Transaction (The Daily Task)

Your **`Main Ledger`** page is now the single source of truth for all money movement.

1.  **Use the Ledger for Everything:** Any time money moves, you must record it here using the **`+ Add Entry`** button.
    *   **Putting money into the business?** Create a **CREDIT** entry from "My Savings" (From) to "INDUSIND Bank" (To).
    *   **Paying an office electricity bill?** Create a **DEBIT** entry from "INDUSIND Bank" (From) to "Electricity Bill" (To).
    *   **Repaying a hand loan?** Create a **DEBIT** entry from "INDUSIND Bank" (From) to "Hand Loan from Thathireddy" (To).

> **Golden Rule:** Every transaction in your real-life bank statement should have a matching entry in the Main Ledger.

### Step 3: Monitor Your Balances (The Reward)

With your accounts set up and your transactions recorded, the application now gives you complete visibility.

1.  **Operational Health:** Use the **`Accounting`** page to see the balances for your day-to-day operations (Customers and Vendors).

2.  **Capital Health:** Use the new **`Capital & Loans`** page to see the big picture:
    *   How much cash is in your bank accounts?
    *   How much do you still owe on your loans or credit cards?
    *   How much have you invested in other ventures?
    *   How much does the business owe you personally?

By following this simple process, you will have a powerful, real-time view of your entire financial situation, making it easy to track every single rupee without the complexity of manual spreadsheets.
